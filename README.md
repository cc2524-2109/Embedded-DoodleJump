Doodle Jump

* The goal of the game (doodle jump) is to get the avatar to jump as high as possible, from platform to platform. The screen would constantly be moving down at a certain speed such that if the avatar falls off the screen or doesn’t jump fast enough, the user loses. Users can control the avatar using the slider from the board. The screen would update the avatar’s position accordingly. 

* Users can alter the speed at which the screen moves downward. The faster/higher the speed, the faster the screen would move down and the harder the game is. Users can alter the speed by clicking on a button on the board where each press would increase the speed by a certain amount.
